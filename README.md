# Boom_Game
This is my first game on pygame
Please enjoy!


## How to use?

1. First you need to have `pygame` on your machine
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

2. After that, you can run the game
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Before you run the game, make sure that the `data` directory is located on the same path as the `main.py` file.
